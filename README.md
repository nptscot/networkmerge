[www.npt.scot](https://www.npt.scot).

For reproducibility, run the code in the [devcontainer](./devcontainer),
follow the installation instructions in the
[publish.yml](./.github/workflows/publish.yml) and try running the
following command, after cloning the repo and changing into the repo
directory:

``` bash
quarto render paper.qmd
```
