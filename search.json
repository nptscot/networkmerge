The main road is represented by a single centreline and with a simplified representation of a roundabout in the northwest (top left) and side roads. The Armley Road example, which comprises 27 segments, by contrast, represents a more complex corridor that is represented by multiple parallel ‘braided’ linestrings on OpenStreetMap. In addition to linestrings representing the road, the corridor contains parallel linestrings representing cycleways.\nThere are two main challenges that need to be overcome to simplify transport networks, in a way that preserves their value:\nSections Section 1 to Section 3 describe methods for simplifying the geometry of the network. The key contributions of the paper are the novel methods of image skeletonisation, presented in Section 2, and simplification with Voronoi diagrams to identify central lines, covered in Section 3. To make use of simplified networks in transport planning, it is also necessary to assign attributes to the simplified network. This is covered in Section 5."

    "text": "2 Simplification via skeletonisation\nThe skeletonisation approach generates a simplified network by buffering the network, applying an image skeletonisation algorithm, and extracting lines segements from a raster of this buffer.\n\nIn both the skeletonisation and Voronoi approaches, the network simplification process starts by applying a buffer to linear geometry in a projected, rather than coordinate system.  We use a buffer size of 8 meters in this paper, which roughly corresponds to the width of a typical road, with the result illustrated in Figure 3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Buffered versions of the Otley Road (left) and Armley Road (right) networks.\n\n\n\n\n2.1 Network skeletonisation\nIn skeletonisation, overlapping lines are identified, buffered, transformed into a raster image, the image processed through a thinning algorithm, and a skeletal representation of the original network produced. This skeletal structure preserves the overall extent and connectivity of the network, with a central line that follows the centre-line of the combined buffered area.\nSkeletonization is only applied to segments where more than one of their respective buffers overlap. To identify overlapping line-segments, the buffer is split at the end of each line-segment, see top Otley Road (left) and Armley Road (right) Figure 4. The overlapping line-segments are then buffered while retaining the remaining disjoint lines, shown in bottom Figure 4.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Segmented line-buffer geometries (top) and geometries to be skeletonized (bottom) for the Otley Road (left) and Armley Road (right) networks.\n\n\n\nAs detail is lost in transforming of the geometry to an image buffer or raster, more detail can be retained by using an affine transformation to increase the number of points in the buffer prior to skeletonisation and reducing scale when creating the simplified linear geometric representation. \n\n\n\nThe raster image also requires pre-processing to eliminate small holes that appear where buffered lines run parallel or intersect at shallow angles.

Line segments are then created by connecting these adjacent points. These points are combined, giving a continuous line geometry representing the simplified network. Finally, a reverse scaling affine transformation is applied to return to the original coordinate system. \nNoting that creating a line geometry from the set of points in the raster buffer is arguable the most complex step.\nThe resulting simplified network is illustrated in Figure 7.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Simplified versions of the Otley Road (left) and Armley Road (right) networks, transformed back into line geometry."

From these sequences, a centre-line is derived based on a set of Voronoi polygons that cover these points. This approach facilitates the creation of a simplified network representation by focusing on the central alignment of the buffered lines.\n\n3.1 Boundary Segmentation\nIn Figure 8, the boundary of the buffered input geometry (otley_geometry) is calculated and then simplified. This process yields a simplified GeoSeries consisting of LineStrings, all of which are precisely aligned with the specified coordinate reference system (CRS). This step illustrates the transformation from the initial buffer geometries, named ‘otley_buffer’ and ‘Armley_buffer’, to their more refined and simplified versions, ‘otley_boundary’ and ‘Armley_boundary’, respectively.

Optionally by removing intermediate lines-sections, a further simplified or primal network that captures the essential connectivity and layout of transport routes can be generated.\n\n4.1 Knots\nKnots in the network are multiple short segments at intersections, resembling tangled knots. To remove these features of networks, which add complexity that is rarely relevant for strategic transport planning, short segments are clustered together, and a central point for each cluster is determined. The end-points of longer lines that connect to these segment clusters are then realigned to the cluster’s central point. This process effectively removes the knot-like appearance.

    "section": "5 Joining route networks",
    "text": "5 Joining route networks\nAfter generating a simplified network using the methods described in the previous sections or through an alternative approach, the next crucial step involves transferring attribute values from the detailed network to the simplified one. This process is commonly referred to as ‘conflation’ and ‘integration’. Conflation is essential because while the source file (detailed network) might be rich in attributes like street names, address ranges, and zip codes, it may lack positional accuracy. Conversely, the target file (simplified network) is likely to be positionally precise but deficient in detailed attributes. As noted by (Sutton 1998), network data integration encompasses two key aspects: the geometric integration, involving the link and node feature elements, and the integration of attributes such as highway data. In our context, the purpose of the joining stage is to merge the detailed attributes from the source network onto the geometrically simplified target network. This ‘joining’ step is vital for using simplified networks as the basis for presenting model outputs generated on a complex network in a easy-to-interpret form. \nThe process is analogous to joining two datasets based on a common ‘key’ variable. In this case there is no definitive key, meaning that network joining can be regarded as a ‘fuzzy’ or ‘keyless’ join process (Suri et al. 2021; Wachowicz and Mrozek 2019): as with the network simplification steps outlined above, the user must select joining parameters to maximise the accuracy of the join. The simplified (typically denoted ‘x’) object can also be referred to as the ‘target’ object, following the terminology used to describe database and ‘spatial similarity’ joins (Ballesteros, Cary, and Rishe 2011). There are at least a couple of implementations of network joining approaches in open source software: the rnet_merge() function in the stplanr R package (Lovelace, Ellison, and Morgan 2019), and the rnetmatch Rust crate which has binding to R and (soon) Python. The details of network joining methods, algorithms and implementations are outside the scope of this paper, see the documentation associated with the projects mentioned above for more information."

    "text": "Route network datasets are fundamental to transport models, serving as both inputs for analysis and outputs for visualisation and decision-making. The increasing complexity of route network data from sources like OpenStreetMap allows for more detailed modelling of sustainable transport modes such as walking and cycling. However, this level of detail can introduce challenges for the clear visualisation and interpretation of model results. A common problem is the representation of single transport corridors by multiple parallel lines, which can create visual clutter and obscure important patterns in transport flows. The purpose of the work presented in this paper is to provide a basis for computationally efficient analysis and visualisation of route networks for strategic transport planning, where intricate geometries—such as parallel or ‘braided’ linestrings—are unhelpful. We present and evaluate two distinct methods for simplifying complex route networks that are intended to be used as a ‘pre‑processing’ step to speed up and improve the results of strategic transport network analysis, modelling and visualisation workflows. First, we present skeletonisation, an approach that uses ‘thinning’ of rasterised network data to extract a simplified representation of the network. Second, we present a Voronoi‑based approach using Voronoi diagrams to identify centrelines. We demonstrate the practical application of these methods using the “Simplified network” layer in the Transport for Scotland funded Network Planning Tool, a publicly accessible resource at www.npt.scot. To support reproducible research, we implement the methods in the open-source parenx Python package, enabling their use alongside other open source tools for transport planning, research and educational applications."

    "section": "3.1 Simplification via skeletonisation",
    "text": "3.1 Simplification via skeletonisation\nThe skeletonisation approach generates a simplified network by buffering the network, applying an image skeletonisation algorithm, and extracting line segments from a raster of this buffer. For an example of the resulting outputs, see the “Skeletonised” column of Figure 2 (Otley: top row; Armley: bottom row).\nAs a common first step, we buffer the lines in a projected coordinate system. We use a buffer size of 8 m in this paper, a value informed by typical widths of a UK two‑lane highway with an example for a typical 2‑way road being specified in the Design Manual for Roads and Bridges (DMRB) as “min 4.8 m, max 8.8 m” and the minimum GB rail centreline track separation of 3.26 m, and two sections of 1.435 m standard gauge. This parameter can be adjusted to suit the use case and local contexts, using the buffer parameter of the simplification functions.\nIn skeletonisation, overlapping lines are identified, buffered, transformed into a raster image, the image processed through a thinning algorithm, and a skeletal representation of the original network produced (see Methods appendix for details). This skeletal structure preserves the overall extent and connectivity of the network, with a central line that follows the centreline of the combined buffered area.\nSpecifically, we apply skeletonisation only where more than one buffered line segment overlaps. To identify overlapping line-segments, the buffer is split at the end of each line-segment. The overlapping line-segments are then buffered while retaining the remaining disjoint lines.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo mitigate rasterisation artefacts introduced by this step, we increase resolution via a uniform affine scale before thinning. As detail is lost in transforming of the geometry to an image buffer or raster, more detail can be retained by using an affine transformation to increase the number of points in the buffer prior to skeletonisation and reducing scale when creating the simplified linear geometric representation. This scale operation is a uniform affine scale transformation applied to increase the detail contained in the raster image. An increase in scale reduces undulation but at the cost of longer processing time and increased memory, which varies as the square of scale value. This transformation is scaled to ensure that the projected coordinate geometry of the network aligns accurately with the corresponding dimensions of the scaled raster image.\nAdditionally, we pre-process the raster to eliminate small holes that appear where buffered lines run parallel or intersect at shallow angles. The skeletonisation algorithm is then applied to the raster image, yielding a skeletal raster image that is converted back into a linear vector geometry, completing the vector-to-raster-to-vector geometry transformation (see Methods appendix for details).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter thinning, we convert the skeleton back to vectors by connecting adjacent pixels into segments and merging them into continuous lines. Line segments are then created by connecting these adjacent points. These segments are combined, giving a continuous line geometry representing the simplified network. Finally, a reverse scaling affine transformation is applied to return to the original coordinate system. \nAmong these stages, the point-to-line reconstruction is the most complex."

Both the skeletonisation and Voronoi approaches are generic methods with the following known issues: they do not preserve links between attributes and the simplified network, nor do they identify subsets of edges that require simplification. Additionally, the resulting lines can be wobbly. The simplification process is memory- and CPU-intensive, and its speed depends on network density and overlap. On commodity hardware, simplifying a core urban road network of 1 km extent takes about 5 seconds, while a 3 km urban core takes 30–60 seconds. Although the Voronoi output is significantly smoother, it is typically 3.6–5.1 times slower than skeletonisation.\nBased on available computing resources, the Voronoi algorithm is used for smaller networks (e.g., those covering approximately 1 km²), while the skeletonisation algorithm is preferred for larger areas (such as 100 km²). Notably, skeletonisation of the entire British rail centreline network took about 5 hours."
