---

Dear Prof. Arribas-Bel, reviewers and editorial team,

We thank you for the opportunity to revise our manuscript and for the constructive feedback provided by the reviewers. We have carefully considered all comments and suggestions and we are confident that the revisions have improved the manuscript. Below, we provide a detailed response to each of the reviewers' comments.

...

To help the review process, we have numbered each of the reviewers' comments and provided our responses with reference to these.

# Reviewer 1

- [ ] **R1.1** With the exception of [Section 3 Data and Methods] (and possibly [Section 1 Introduction]), all sections need a healthy fleshing out. There is simply not enough language, for example [Section 4 Application to Edinburgh City Centre] is only 3 sentences long. 

<!-- TODO: Check over the sections (RL) -->

- [ ] **R1.2** There are large swaths of the text that read choppily with no real transitions. 

# Reviewer 2

The paper tackles a task that is not easy - the simplification of road networks. While it provides reusable software and two different algorithms that solve the problem at hand, the paper itself lacks some key components that would allow users to properly evaluate the usefulness of this contribution. Please see the points below. 

- [x] **R2.1** My main comment relates to understanding how good these algorithms are and which is actually better. The paper provides no comparison of the two beyond the visual comparison in Figures 2 and 3. Nor does it provide any validation, leaving the reader without a much-needed understanding of the performance of the proposed methods. Do they do the job well? In which cases are they perfect and in which do they struggle? What are the limitations of the resulting geometry? The paper does not answer any of these questions. My suggestion is to include a section with an explicit comparison of the two methods and guidance on which should be used when. 

We have added a new section titled "Skeletonization versus Voronoi" which compares the two algorithms, compares their performance with reference to performance and size.
Importantly, we now highlight the performance benefits of the skeletonization approach for large networks, also highlighting the smoother output of the Voronoi approach.

- [ ] **R2.2** On top of that, it would be great to see a comparison to some ground truth data (I am not sure if the primal network is not that, see below). 

<!-- TODO:
We compared the outputs of our simplification methods against an independent and authoritative source of road network data, Ordnance Survey's OpenRoads data product. -->

- [x] **R2.3** The parenx API is rather unusual. One would assume that a Python package could be imported and used in memory, but this does not seem to be the case as the only documented API is the CLI. Which is strange in itself. Instead of using something like `parenx skeletonize in.geojson out.geojson` and `parenx voronoi in.geojson out.geojson`, which is a common model, it registers `skeletonize.py` and `voronoi.py`, suggesting a Python file rather than a function name. With proper documentation this is probably fine, I just find these choices really weird and incompatible with the rest of the ecosystem. 

We have updated the implementation of the methods in the `parenx` package, which has been updated on PyPI and GitHub:

- The package now exposes the core simplfication functions in the `parenx` namespace, so users and developers can import them directly in their Python code. These improvements are highlighted in the following example from the updated `parenx` documentation (previously this would have generated an error):

```python
import geopandas as gp
from parenx import skeletonize_frame, voronoi_frame, skeletonize_tiles, get_primal

CRS = "EPSG:27700"
filepath = "data/rnet_princes_street.geojson"
frame = gp.read_file(filepath).to_crs(CRS)

parameter = {"simplify": 0.0, "buffer": 8.0, "scale": 1.0, "knot": False, "segment": False}
r = skeletonize_frame(frame["geometry"], parameter)

parameter = {"simplify": 0.0, "scale": 5.0, "buffer": 8.0, "tolerance": 1.0}
r = voronoi_frame(frame["geometry"], parameter)

primal = get_primal(r)
```

See the appendix for more details on the CLI and the API.

- We have updated the function names to be more descriptive, e.g. `get_nx()` is now `get_primal()`, matching the description in the paper.
- We have provided a command-line interface (CLI) that works from shell environments, allowing users to run the methods without needing to write Python code. The CLI uses the command `parenx` and, as the reviewer suggested, takes the algorithm name as the first argument (either `skeletonize` or `voronoi`, without needing the `.py` suffix). 

## Other minor comments

- [ ] **R2.4** The title says that the algorithms are aimed at transport planning, but in the text the authors also mention other applications. This is a bit confusing. 
- [ ] **R2.5** The paper repeatedly refers to the appendix with a cookbook and the methods section. However, this appendix is not part of the review package. At least I could not find it anywhere. It is not possible for me to assess the details of any of the methods at this moment. 

- [x] **R2.6**  Line 14 on p. 2 contains "->", which probably should not be there. 

Done.

- [x] **R2.7**  Fleischmann and Vybornova n.d. seems to have been published in the meantime at 10.5311/JOSIS.2024.28.319. 

Done.

- [x] **R2.8** Suri et al. n.d. also appears to have been published at 10.14778/3494124.3494149. 

Done.

- [x] **R2.9**  The buffer chosen in section 3.1 is 8. Why? Is it better than 7 or 9? How is this determined? How should a user specify this in their case study? 

We have clarified in section 3.1 that the 8 m buffer was chosen to reflect UK road widths, referencing the Design Manual for Roads and Bridges (DMRB) and standard rail track separation. This value is now justified. We also state that the `buffer` argument in the simplification functions can be used to adjust the buffer size depending on reader/user needs in the main body of the paper.

- [x] **R2.10** P.5 l.31 contains a typo "skeltonisation". 

Done.

- [x] **R2.11** This may be in the appendix, which I haven't received, but the main text would also benefit from understanding the resolution of the raster component in skeletonisation and the reasoning behind it. 

We have explained the transformation and how it influences the results, e.g. to reduce the 'wiggliness' of the skeletonized output. We now state in the main body of the paper:

> This scale operation is a uniform affine scale transformation applied to increase the detail contained in the raster image. An increase in scale reduces undulation but at the cost of longer processing time and increased memory, which varies as the square of scale value. This transformation is scaled to ensure that the projected coordinate geometry of the network aligns accurately with the corresponding dimensions of the scaled raster image.

We now include the appendix in the submission.

- [x] **R2.12** The same applies to the segmentation step of the Voronoi-based approach, as this can significantly affect the result.

Details were included in the appendix, which is now included in the submission and appropriately referenced in the main body of the paper. 

- [ ] **R2.13**  I would suggest including titles for the columns in the figure for additional clarity and to eliminate the need to refer to the caption. 

- [x] **R2.14** Figure 3 contains a "primitive mesh". What is it, how was it created? It is unclear what we are looking at. 

We have clarified what this means with the following additional sentence:

> This highly simplified network is created by identifying all nodes in the network, counting the edges connected to each node, and removing all nodes that are connected to exactly two edges. Unconnected edges or those at intersections between edges are retained.

- [ ] **R2.15** Figure 3 contains images that are too small and it is difficult to see the differences. 

# Reviewer 3

This work addresses a relevant issue, i.e., route network simplification, which is here framed in the context of transportation planning, but has significance that goes beyond transportation planning - in any other field of study where route or street networks are used for spatial modelling. The methods presented here are highly relevant to the issue at hand, novel, and available to the wider community in packaged open-source format. I therefore recommend the publication of this article, with several minor caveats (minor revision) -- see my comments below.

General comments:
- [x] **R3.1** the text itself could use a fresh pair of eyes for revision due to several typoes, unfinished sentences, etc.
- [ ] **R3.2** i answered "no" to the question above, "Are the interpretations and conclusions justified by the results?", mostly because i think there needs to be a more clear *interpretation* of parenx outcomes, see my comments on the "edinburgh use case" section below

## abstract
- [ ] **R3.3** can it be made more clear what the _purpose_ of the paper is? (presenting parenx which enables the simplification of route networks by 2 methods, ...)
- [ ] **R3.4** "new contexts" >> which contexts? (more specific?)

## introduction
- [ ] **R3.6** would be good to re-do the definitions used here to be more clear and concise. e.g. the nodes/edges/lines sentence with the several parentheses is a bit hard to read and somewhat circular in its definitions. Potentially helpful to refer to a plot here? (if there is space for more plots)
- [ ] **R3.7** also be more clear about difference/overlap between "route network", "transport network data set", "spatial networks" etc.
- [ ] **R3.8** "Route network simplification can be applied to transport model networks" >> i would argue that route network simplification can be applied to many more contexts (basically anywhere that spatial networks are used) -- could help argue for the significance of the work?
- [x] **R3.9** OSM mention: add citation
- [x] **R3.10** "unsolved challenge for other applications" >> say which (or give at least some examples)
- [ ] **R3.11** "The aim of this paper..." >> this sentence/its contents should ideally come earlier / as early as possible (first page of paper)

## problem definition
- [ ] **R3.12** why a bullet point list for _limitations_ of the existing approach? are these limitations identical with the problem definition (it seems to me that they are not?)
- [ ] **R3.13** would be great to have a plot here (e.g. a parenx before//after detail) to use it to explain what exactly the authors mean by "simplification". (ambiguous word - cf the differing use in the osmnx package, etc.)

## Data and Methods
- [ ] **R3.14** this section only describes methods, what about the data? could be a place to also comment on the edinburgh city center use case?
- [ ] **R3.15** Introduce references to (subfigures of) Figure 2 in the methods subsections
- [x] **R3.16** skeletonization buffer size 8 meters: at first glance this seems to me use-case specific, not part of methods? so: if this is a location-based choice, i would suggest to move it to the use case description and there argue why 8m was chosen. if this is a general recommendation for future parenx use i would leave this here but then comment on the reasoning behind the choice of the buffer size
- [x] **R3.17** skeletonization: last sentence of section 3.1. is cut short
- [ ] **R3.18** joining route networks: if this is not part of parenx (if i grasped this correctly) and also not part of the Edinburgh use case (?), then maybe this can be shortened/doesn't need its own subsection? (Could be moved to discussion/future work?)

## Application to Edinburgh
This section seems way too short, i would suggest to say more here (if word limit need to be respected, then maybe at the expense of summarizing a bit more the lit review part?), e.g. about
- why this usecase, what are its particularities,
- what is the goal of the simplification process here (e.g. "removing the roundabouts", etc.)
- what should the reader pay attention to when comparing before/after parenx in figure 4,
- how do the authors evaluate their own method based on this use case,
- what are the differences between the 2 different parenx methods (point out where in figure 4 this becomes apparent?),
- etc.

## Conclusion
- [ ] **R3.19** "we believe it has applications.." >> i think the authors can be more confident about this ("we believe" is not necessary, you can state that there are in fact applications - & say which)
