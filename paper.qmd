# Abstract {.unnumbered}

Route network datasets are fundamental to transport models, serving as both inputs for analysis and outputs for visualisation and decision-making.
The increasing complexity of route network data from sources like OpenStreetMap [@openstreetmap] allows for more detailed modelling of sustainable transport modes such as walking and cycling.
However, this level of detail can introduce challenges for the clear visualisation and interpretation of model results.
A common problem is the representation of single transport corridors by multiple parallel lines, which can create visual clutter and obscure important patterns in transport flows.
This paper addresses these issues by presenting and evaluating two distinct methods for simplifying complex route networks: 1) a raster-based approach using image skeletonization, and 2) a vector-based approach using Voronoi diagrams to identify centrelines.
We demonstrate the practical application of these methods using the "Simplified network" layer in the Transport for Scotland funded Network Planning Tool, a publicly accessible resource at [www.npt.scot](https://www.npt.scot).
The methods are implemented in the open-source `parenx` Python package, ensuring they are reproducible, adaptable, and ready for application in new transport planning contexts.

# Introduction

Datasets representing route networks are foundational to transport planning, serving a dual role as both inputs to and outputs from transport models.
As inputs, they provide the digital representation of the physical world on which transport systems operate.
As outputs, they are used to visualise the results of transport models, for example showing levels of predicted demand or network performance on specific routes.
More specifically, transport network datasets are *spatial networks* composed of nodes (junctions) and edges (links or ways), where each edge has an associated cost, such as its length or travel time [@barthélemy2011].
In practice, these components are geographically located, with edges representing the physical infrastructure of the transport network, often enriched with attributes like the type of way (e.g., motorway, cycle path), its physical characteristics, and usage data such as daily traffic volumes.
Accordingly, route network simplification can be applied to both input and output networks, aiming to reduce complexity while preserving the essential spatial structure and relevant attributes of the network.

The growing availability of high-resolution geographic datasets, from open sources like OpenStreetMap and authoritative mapping agencies, has enabled the creation of increasingly detailed maps.
This trend, powered by advances in hardware and software, is beneficial for sustainable transport planning, which relies on accurate and detailed network information.
However, the very intricacy of modern street network geometries can create significant problems.
For transport model outputs to be useful to planners and the public, a clear and intuitive visual representation is crucial for identifying issues such as bottlenecks, congestion hotspots, and areas of poor accessibility.
Consequently, network simplification has become a vital step in the transport planning workflow, aligning with established cartographic principles of 'map generalization' for pre-processing datasets according to the scale of analysis [@sutton1998].
Despite being a long-standing challenge, the simplification of networks for transport planning and other applications remains an active area of research.

Existing vector geometry simplification methods, such as the Douglas-Peucker and Visvalingam-Whyatt algorithms, are effective at reducing the number of vertices in a line and thus file sizes, but they do not address the problem of network complexity arising from multiple parallel lines representing a single real-world corridor [@liu2020vector; @de2014efficient].
Similarly, vector smoothing techniques can improve the aesthetic quality of network visualisations; however, they do not simplify the underlying network structure [@pradhan2023modified; @duong2022statistical].

A more promising approach involves converting the linear network into an intermediate polygon (buffer) layer and then deriving a simplified centreline, or 'medial axis'.
This concept has been explored in various open-source software implementations [e.g. @smogavec2012; @centerli2023].
Recent work in this area includes the `neatnet` Python package [@fleischmann2024] and the `parenx` package [@deakin2024], the latter of which forms the basis of the methods presented in this paper.
Other related methods focus on identifying and removing specific types of network artefacts, such as small loops or 'slivers' between dual carriageways to simplify street blocks [@fleischmann; @grippa2018].
However, these methods often lack the flexibility to control the level of simplification.

While the focus of this paper is on route network simplification for transport planning, and applications to other fields are beyond its scope, it is worth noting prior research tackling the challenge of simplifying linear features in other domains.
In hydrology, for example, researchers require simplified centrelines of rivers derived from datasets representing river banks for applications such as flood mapping and morphological analysis, with implementations in tools like the R package `cmgo` [@golly2017] and RivWidthCloud for Google Earth Engine [@yang2020].
The `riverdist` R package also provides functionality to simplify braided river channels into a single path [@tyers2016].
The methods presented in this paper draw inspiration from these wider applications of linear feature simplification.
More broadly, our approach is based on techniques that can be applied to any set of overlapping linear features where aggregation is desired, such as simplifying transport or other flow networks to create a consolidated route-view for capacity analysis or strategic modelling.

The aim of this paper is to articulate the problem of complex route networks, present solutions with implementations in open source software for reproducible research, and describe applications of the methods to support more effective transport planning.
We proceed as follows: @sec-problem outlines the problem of complex route networks.
@sec-methods presents methods for route network simplification alongside results based on the example datasets.
@sec-application demonstrates the methods applied to a real transport network (Edinburgh, Scotland) and @sec-discussion concludes with a discussion of the results and future work.

# Problem definition {#sec-problem}

The problem tackled in this paper is the simplification of complex route networks.
This can be illustrated with reference to the Propensity to Cycle Tool for England (PCT) [@lovelace2017], the route networks of which are based on methods for aggregating multiple overlapping routes into a route network with non-overlapping linestrings [@morgan2020].
Implemented in the function `overline()` in the `stplanr` R package [@lovelace2017], the methods enable visualization of large transport networks and inform investment decisions in transport planning internationally [@lovelace2024; @félix2025].
However, this 'overline' approach, without further processing, has limitations:

-   Functionally redundant vertices are kept, leading to large file sizes and slow rendering.
-   Parallel ways that are not merged.

The latter issue is particularly problematic for visualisation of transport networks, as shown in @fig-pct [@lovelace2017].
The left panel shows Otley Road with a flow value of 818 (@fig-otley-road).
The right panel, by contrast, shows three parallel ways parallel to Armley Road with flow values of 515 (shown), 288 and 47 (values not shown) (@fig-armley-road).
Although this section of Armley road has a higher cycling potential than the section of Otley Road shown (515 + 288 + 47 \> 818), this is not clear from the visualisation.

Note that it is not clear from the visualisation that the corridor shown in the right hand figures (Armley Road corridor) has greater flow than the corridor shown in the left (Otley Road).
Note also the visual artefacts such as 'staircase' effects and overlapping values resulting from parallel lines along Armley Road (right panel).

There are two main challenges that need to be overcome to simplify transport networks, in a way that preserves their value:

1.  Simplifying the *geometry*
2.  Assigning attributes to the simplified network

We address the geometric simplification first, describing skeletonization and then a Voronoi-based approach.
The key contributions of the paper are the novel methods of image skeletonization, presented in @sec-simplification-via-skeletonization, and simplification with Voronoi diagrams to identify central lines, covered in @sec-simplification-via-voronoi-polygons.
<!-- To make use of simplified networks in transport planning, it is also necessary to assign attributes to the simplified network.
This is covered in @sec-joining-route-networks. -->

```{=html}
<!-- TODO: shouldn't the following topics be stand-alone subsections rather than existing within the skeletonization section?
Additionally, the section tackles challenges associated with knots at intersections, offering solutions for their removal to simplify the network's appearance.
The concept of a primal network that represents a high level of simplification is explored as well. -->
```

<!-- ## Topology-preserving simplification {#sec-topology-preserving-simplification}

Topology-preserving simplification reduces the number of vertices in a linestring while preserving (or at least attempting to preserve) the topology of the network, i.e. not merging parallel lines. -->

## Simplification via skeletonization {#sec-simplification-via-skeletonization}

The skeletonization approach generates a simplified network by buffering the network, applying an image skeletonization algorithm, and extracting lines segements from a raster of this buffer.

<!--- ### Create a projected combined buffered geometry --->

As a common first step, we buffer the lines in a projected coordinate system.
<!-- , achieved using the `get_geometry_buffer` function. -->
We use a buffer size of 8 m in this paper. This value is informed by typical widths of a UK two-lane highway with an example for a typical 2-way road being specified in the [Design Manual for Roads and Bridges (DMRB)](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5a7e0035ed915d74e6223743/pdfmanforstreets.pdf#page=81) as "min 4.8 m, max 8.8 m" and the minimum GB rail centre-line track separation of 3.26m, and two sections of 1.435m standard gauge.
This parameter can be adjusted to suit the use case and local contexts, using the `buffer` parameter of the simplification functions.

```

<!-- ### Network skeletonization -->

In skeletonization, overlapping lines are identified, buffered, transformed into a raster image, the image processed through a thinning algorithm, and a skeletal representation of the original network produced (see [Methods](https://nptscot.github.io/networkmerge/methods.html) appendix for details).
This skeletal structure preserves the overall extent and connectivity of the network, with a central line that follows the centre-line of the combined buffered area.

Specifically, we apply skeletonization only where more than one buffered line segment overlaps.
To identify overlapping line-segments, the buffer is split at the end of each line-segment.
The overlapping line-segments are then buffered while retaining the remaining disjoint lines.

```{=html}
<!---This visualization demonstrates the process of cutting and segmenting the buffer geometries. It highlights the transformations from the initial buffered geometries to a more segmented and manageable form, preparing them for further analysis and simplification steps​.
It effectively highlights the contrast between the more intricate and the simpler sections within these networks. --->

<!-- Segmented line-buffer geometries (top) and geometries to be skeletonized (bottom) for the Otley Road (left) and Armley Road (right) networks. -->
<!-- ::: -->

To mitigate rasterization artefacts introduced by this step, we increase resolution via a uniform affine scale before thinning.
As detail is lost in transforming of the geometry to an image buffer or raster, more detail can be retained by using an affine transformation to increase the number of points in the buffer prior to skeletonization and reducing scale when creating the simplified linear geometric representation.
This scale operation is a uniform affine scale transformation applied to increase the detail contained in the raster image. An increase in scale reduces undulation but at the cost of longer processing time and increased memory, which varies as the square of scale value. This transformation is scaled to ensure that the projected coordinate geometry of the network aligns accurately with the corresponding dimensions of the scaled raster image.

Additionally, we pre-process the raster to eliminate small holes that appear where buffered lines run parallel or intersect at shallow angles.
The skeletonization algorithm is then applied to the raster image, yielding a skeletal raster image that is converted back into a linear vector geometry, completing the vector-to-raster-to-vector geometry transformation (see [Methods](https://nptscot.github.io/networkmerge/methods.html) appendix for details).

<!-- Skeletonized versions of the Otley Road (left) and Armley Road (right) networks, transformed back into point geometry.

After thinning, we convert the skeleton back to vectors by connecting adjacent pixels into segments and merging them into continuous lines.
Line segments are then created by connecting these adjacent points.
These segments are combined, giving a continuous line geometry representing the simplified network.
Finally, a reverse scaling affine transformation is applied to return to the original coordinate system.
<!-- This conversion from point to line geometry is a pivotal aspect of network simplification. -->

Among these stages, the point-to-line reconstruction is the most complex.

## Simplification via Voronoi polygons {#sec-simplification-via-voronoi-polygons}

In contrast to skeletonization, the Voronoi method remains in vector space until the end and derives centrelines from buffered boundaries.
Voronoi simplification takes the buffered network segments and converts them into a set of points.
The edges of these buffers are then segmented into sequences of points.
From these sequences, a centre-line is derived based on a set of Voronoi polygons that cover these points.
For more detail on segmentation and Voronoi simplification see the [Appendix](https://nptscot.github.io/networkmerge/methods.html#sec-simplification-via-voronoi-polygons).
This approach facilitates the creation of a simplified network representation by focusing on the central alignment of the buffered lines.

:::

## Post-Processing

Both skeletonization and Voronoi outputs require post-processing to remove 'knots'—short, tangled segments that form near intersections.
To remove these features, short segments are clustered together, and a central point for each cluster is determined.
The end-points of longer lines that connect to these segment clusters are then realigned to the cluster's central point, as illustrated in the [Methods](https://nptscot.github.io/networkmerge/methods.html) appendix.

An additional optional stage is to simplify the network further by removing vertices that are not essential for the network's connectivity, resulting in a primal network that captures the essential connectivity and layout of transport routes.
The primal network is thus composed of direct lines connecting start and end points, representing a high level of simplification that prioritises the network's structure and compression.

<!-- The primal networks for the Otley Road and Armley Road skeletonized networks are illustrated in @fig-primal-skeleton. -->

## Skeletonization versus Voronoi

With both pipelines defined, we summarize known limitations and performance trade-offs.
Both the skeletonization and Voronoi approaches are generic methods with the following known issues: they do not preserve links between attributes and the simplified network, nor do they identify subsets of edges that require simplification. Additionally, the resulting lines can be wobbly. The simplification process is memory- and CPU-intensive, and its speed depends on network density and overlap. On commodity hardware, simplifying a core urban road network of 1 km extent takes about 5 seconds, while a 3 km urban core takes between 30 and 60 seconds. Although the Voronoi output is significantly smoother, it is typically 3.6 to 5.1 times slower than skeletonization.

Based on available computing resources, the Voronoi algorithm is used for smaller networks (e.g., those covering approximately 1 km²), while the skeletonization algorithm is preferred for larger areas (such as 100 km²). Notably, skeletonization of the entire British rail center-line network took about 5 hours.

## Joining route networks {#sec-joining-route-networks}

Having simplified the geometry, we next consider how to transfer attributes from the detailed network to the simplified one.
 <!-- described in the previous sections or through an alternative approach, the next crucial step involves transferring attribute values from the detailed network to the simplified one.
This process is commonly referred to as 'conflation' and 'integration'.
Conflation is essential because while the source file (detailed network) might be rich in attributes like street names, address ranges, and zip codes, it may lack positional accuracy.
Conversely, the target file (simplified network) is likely to be positionally precise but deficient in detailed attributes. -->
<!-- As noted by [@sutton1998], this process involves two key aspects: the geometric integration, involving the link and node feature elements, and the integration of attributes such as highway data. -->
In the context of network planning tools, the purpose of the joining stage is to join traffic estimates from the source network onto the geometrically simplified target network [@sutton1998].
<!-- This 'joining' step is vital for using simplified networks as the basis for presenting model outputs generated on a complex network in a easy-to-interpret form. -->
<!-- In instances where a simplified version of the network is readily available, such as the Ordnance Survey's Open Roads dataset in the UK, the steps for network simplification can be bypassed to save time.
We have implemented the steps presented in this section in the `rnet_merge()` function in the `stplanr` R package. -->

<!-- The process is analogous to joining two datasets based on a common 'key' variable. -->
In this case there is no definitive key, meaning that network joining can be regarded as a 'fuzzy' or 'keyless' join process [@suri; @wachowicz2019]: as with the network simplification steps outlined above, the user must select joining parameters to maximise the accuracy of the join.
There are at least a couple of implementations of network joining methods in open source software: the `rnet_merge()` function in the `stplanr` R package [@lovelace2019], and the [`rnetmatch` Rust crate](https://github.com/nptscot/rnetmatch/tree/main/rust) for which has bindings to R and Python are planned.
The details of network joining methods, algorithms and implementations are outside the scope of this paper, see the documentation associated with the projects mentioned above for more information.

<!-- **Data Preparation:** -->

<!-- The main inputs of the network merging function are two route networks: `rnet_x` (the simple network geometry) and `rnet_y` (the original network with a more complex geometry and attributes that need to be translated onto the new network). -->

<!-- `rnet_y` in this case represents the detailed network with attributes such as model outputs representing transport flows to be translated onto the new network. -->

<!-- **Step 1: Coordinate Reference System Alignment** -->

```{=html}
<!-- Transform the spatial data of both `rnet_x` (the simplified network) and `rnet_y` (the detailed network) to the same coordinate reference system.
For this project, we have selected EPSG:27700. -->
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| eval: false
rnet_xp = sf::st_transform(rnet_x, "EPSG:27700")
rnet_yp = sf::st_transform(rnet_y, "EPSG:27700")
```

<!-- **Step 2: Defining the Function List** -->

```{=html}
<!-- Create a function list that dictates how each attribute is to be processed:

-   **Exclude**: "geometry" from processing.

-   **Mean Function**: Applied to attributes like "Gradient" and "Quietness".
    TODO expline the funtion of sum and mean

-   **Sum Function**: Used for aggregating values in columns such as "all_bicycle".

**Step 3: Using `stplanr::rnet_merge` for Integration**

Employ the `rnet_merge` function from the `stplanr` package.
This function is designed to merge route network data, taking into account the predefined functions and alignment in the coordinate system. -->
```

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: false
rnet_merged = stplanr::rnet_merge(rnet_xp, rnet_yp, dist = 20, segment_length = 10, funs = funs, max_angle_diff = 30) 
```

```{=html}
<!-- The network joining function can also take a number of arguments that define how the attributes are translated to the simplified target network:

-   **`dist`** (Buffer Distance): This parameter defines the buffer zone around `rnet_xp` in meters, for determining the proximity at which features from both networks are considered for merging.
    Typically, this value is refined to approximate the width of streets, ensuring a realistic spatial correlation between the network elements.

-   **`segment_length`** (Maximum Segment Length): This optional argument (with 0 being the default meaning no splitting) specifies the maximum length of segments in `rnet_y` before they are split.
    Segmenting long segments in the detailed network reduces number of source geometries that do not fit within target geometries, which can be key for achieving higher accuracy in attribute integration. -->
```

```{=html}
<!-- -   **`funs`** (Function List): Comprises a series of key-value pairs representing variable names and the function to apply to each.
    Any function can be used, with sum and mean being typical values.

-   **`max_angle_diff`** (Maximum Angular Difference): This argument specifies the maximum angular difference between segments and target lines for values in matching source geometries to be translated to the target simplified geometries.
    A low value, such as 20 degrees, ensures that values are translated only to segments with similar orientations, preventing overestimation of values on side roads.
    @fig-max_angle_diff demonstrates the impact of this parameter in preventing the overestimation of values on side roads. -->
```

```{=html}

<!-- An optional `sum_flows` argument can be used to ensure that more influential lines have a proportionate impact on the final aggregated value for each geometry in the simplified network.
The formula for the weighted sum is:

$$
\text{Weighted Sum} = \sum (x_i \times w_i)
$$

Where `xi` represents the attribute value for the i-th line in the complex network, and `wi` is the length weight for the i-th line. -->
```

```{=html}
<!-- An optional normalization step adjusts the values associated with each feature in the simplified network.
This adjustment ensures that the total flow values of both the complex and simplified networks are equivalent.
The need for normalization arises from the fact that simplified networks typically have a reduced total length and are less circuitous compared to their complex counterparts. -->
```

```{=html}
<!-- The normalization process is governed by the following formula:

$$
\text{Normalized Value} = \frac{\text{Weighted Sum}}{\sum w_i}
$$

Additionally, to account for potential overestimation of values in the simplified network, the following formula is applied:

$$
\text{over\_estimate} = \frac{\sum(\text{Aggregated Value} \times \text{Length of Single Line})}{\sum(\text{Original Value} \times \text{Length of Lines in Complex Network})}
$$

The final step involves adjusting the normalized value to correct any overestimation, as calculated above:

$$
\text{Adjusted Value} = \frac{\text{Normalized Value}}{\text{over\_estimate}}
$$

Through these steps, the normalized and adjusted values more accurately reflect the true distribution and intensity of flows within the simplified network, preserving the overall data integrity. -->

<!-- To calculate max_angle_diff, it's necessary to accurately calculate the angles (bearings) of lines from two networks, rnet_x$angle_x and rnet_y$angle_y.
The difference in these angles is then computed as rnetj$angle_diff <- rnetj$angle_y - rnetj\$angle_x.
In this study, the line_bearing function is defined to calculate the angle.
As shown below,
       
rnet$angle = line_bearing(rnet_y, bidirectional = TRUE)

The process of calculating the bidirectional bearing of a line segment in geographical coordinates involves normalizing the standard bearing so that it is the same regardless of the direction of travel along the line.
Below is the detailed formula:

1.  **Convert Latitudes and Longitudes to Radians**:

$$
\text{lat}_1 = \text{lat}_1 \times \frac{\pi}{180}
$$

$$
\text{lat}_2 = \text{lat}_2 \times \frac{\pi}{180}
$$

$$
\text{lon}_1 = \text{lon}_1 \times \frac{\pi}{180}
$$

$$
\text{lon}_2 = \text{lon}_2 \times \frac{\pi}{180}
$$

2.  **Calculate Bearing**:

$$
\Delta lon = lon_2 - lon_1
$$

$$
\theta = atan2(\sin(\Delta lon) \times \cos(lat_2), \cos(lat_1) \times \sin(lat_2) - \sin(lat_1) \times \cos(lat_2) \times \cos(\Delta lon))
$$

3.  **Convert Bearing from Radians to Degrees and Normalize Bidirectional Bearing to \[0, 180) Degrees**:

$$
\theta = \theta \times \frac{180}{\pi}
$$

$$
\theta = \theta \mod 180
$$

In this bidirectional adjustment, the bearing is normalized to a range of \[0, 180) degrees.
This means that opposite directions along a line yield the same bearing value.
This approach is particularly useful in scenarios where the directionality of the line is not a primary concern, ensuring consistency in bearing values regardless of the line's travel direction.

<!-- After the joining process has completed, a series of post-processing steps can refine the results:

-   **Cleaning**: The `rnet_merged` dataset undergoes an initial cleaning phase where superfluous columns are removed.
    This step enhances dataset manageability and focuses on relevant data by eliminating columns such as 'identifier' and 'length_x'.

-   **Dimensionality Reduction**: Z and M dimensions are removed from the dataset, as they are redundant for our analysis and contribute to unnecessary increases in file size.
    This reduction simplifies the dataset and optimizes it for storage and processing efficiency.

-   **NA Handling**: A thorough examination is conducted for the presence of NA values across the columns.
    Any rows where all the targeted columns contain NA values are filtered out.

-   **Spatial Subsetting**: Following the removal of linestrings that contain NA attributes from the `rnet_merged` dataset, we proceed to create a geometric buffer zone.
    This zone serves as a spatial criterion for identifying and retaining only those geometries that lie outside of this buffer.
    A subset of `rnet_yp`, termed `rnet_yp_rest`, is then delineated based on this spatial relationship, effectively omitting any geometries that intersect with or fall within the buffered area.
    This step ensures that only those components of `rnet_y` which are spatially distinct from `rnet_merged` are retained for further consideration.

-   **Network Simplification**: In the final stage of simplification, the datasets `rnet_yp_rest` and `rnet_merged_all` are combined to form the final network, which retains the simplicity of the original simplified structure while concurrently encompassing the detailed attributes, thereby providing a comprehensive yet efficient foundation for further analysis.

These post-processing steps are adaptable and can be customized according to the specific requirements of the analysis. -->

<!-- ## Combined network simplification and attribute merging -->

# Application to Edinburgh City Centre {#sec-application}

To demonstrate the practical application and effectiveness of the proposed simplification techniques, we apply them to a complex urban road network in the city centre of Edinburgh, Scotland.
This area is characterised by a dense network of streets, including multi-lane roads, one-way systems, and historic streets, making it a challenging and realistic test case for network simplification.
The input dataset for this area, as shown in the top-left panel of @fig-results, contains numerous parallel lines representing dual carriageways and other complex road features.

We apply both methods with consistent parameters to enable a fair comparison.
The results of our simplification methods are illustrated in the remaining panels of @fig-results.
The skeletonized network (top right) provides a simplified representation of the input dataset.
This method effectively collapses the dual carriageways into single centrelines, while preserving the overall connectivity of the network.
The resulting network is visually much cleaner than the original, making it easier to interpret traffic flows or other network attributes that might be displayed on it.

The Voronoi-based simplification (bottom left) offers an alternative simplified network.
Like the skeletonization approach, it successfully merges parallel lines.
Visually, the lines produced by the Voronoi method can be smoother and more geometrically regular than those from the skeletonization method, which may be advantageous for certain cartographic applications.
<!-- TODO: Add a sentence here to compare the skeletonized and Voronoi results for Edinburgh in more detail, if possible. For example, are there any noticeable differences in how they handle specific intersections? -->

Finally, the primal network (bottom right) represents the highest level of simplification.
This network is created by removing all nodes that are not intersections, effectively representing the network as a series of direct connections between junctions.
This level of abstraction is particularly useful for strategic network analysis, where the focus is on connectivity and network structure rather than precise geographical representation.
For example, it could be used as an input for graph-based analysis of network resilience or for creating schematic maps of the transport system.

Overall, the application to Edinburgh city centre demonstrates that both the skeletonization and Voronoi methods are capable of transforming a complex, detailed road network into a range of simplified representations suitable for different transport planning and analysis purposes.
The choice of method and level of simplification will depend on the specific requirements of the task, from creating clear visualisations of model outputs to conducting high-level strategic network analysis.

It is observed that the attribute `value` from the original network has been correctly transferred to the simplified network via a `sum` calculation process.
This comparison between the original and simplified Edinburgh Road Networks demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed simplification techniques in maintaining the essential characteristics of the network while reducing its complexity. -->

# Discussion and Conclusion {#sec-discussion}

In summary, this paper has presented and demonstrated two novel methods for simplifying complex route networks: one based on image skeletonization and the other on Voronoi diagrams.
Both methods are implemented in open-source software, ensuring that the research is reproducible and the tools are available for others to use and adapt (see the reproducible source code of this paper at [github.com/nptscot](https://github.com/nptscot)).
The results show that both skeletonization and Voronoi-based approaches can successfully transform complex, multi-lined representations of transport corridors into simplified single-line geometries.
This simplification process results in networks that are substantially less resource-intensive for subsequent analysis and, crucially, lead to clearer and more intuitive visualisations of transport model outputs.
While both methods achieve the primary goal of simplification, they have different characteristics.
The skeletonization approach is generally faster, making it more suitable for very large networks.
By contrast, the Voronoi approach, while more computationally intensive, can produce smoother and more aesthetically pleasing centrelines.
The choice between them, and the selection of parameters that control the level of simplification, will depend on the specific requirements of the analysis and the available computing resources.
Finally, a key advantage of our implementation in the `parenx` Python package is its flexibility, allowing users to tailor the simplification process from minor adjustments to the aggressive simplification of a 'primal network', as shown in the [`parenx` cookbook](https://nptscot.github.io/networkmerge/cookbook.html).

Looking ahead, there are several promising directions for future research building on this work.
One avenue is the exploration of alternative algorithms for generating centrelines from buffered networks.
This could include recursive thinning algorithms like the grassfire algorithm [@leymarie1992], or other medial axis transform algorithms [e.g. @smogavec2012].
Another important area for development is performance enhancement.
In particular, the speed of the process could be improved through parallelisation, implementation in lower-level programming languages such as Rust, or further optimisation of the core algorithms.
<!-- TODO: Mention the challenge of attribute conflation as a key area for future work, as it's a complex problem that this paper only touches on. -->

The methods presented in this paper were initially developed to support the Network Planning Tool for Scotland, where they provide a strong evidence base for data-driven investment in active travel infrastructure.
However, their applicability extends far beyond this initial use case.
These tools have significant potential in other areas of transport planning, such as strategic rail network modelling, public transport network design, and the redesign of urban street networks to create more sustainable and equitable transport systems.
By providing a robust and flexible solution to the long-standing problem of network simplification, this work contributes to the broader goal of making transport planning more effective, evidence-based, and accessible.
