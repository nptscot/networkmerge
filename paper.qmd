# Introduction

Datasets representing route networks are central to transport planning.
Unlike other key types of data used in transport planning, route networks are both a key input *and* key output.
Origin-destination, GPS, and remote sensing imagery datasets are all key inputs but rarely feature as outputs of transport models.
Global and local estimates of costs and benefits associated with changes to transport systems, geographic outputs at regional, local and corridor level, and visualisation of agents on the system are common outputs.
However, route network datasets are ubiquitous as both transport model inputs (typically representing road networks) outputs (typically with model outputs such as flow per time of day).[^1]

[^1]: See the [online documentation](https://sumo.dlr.de/docs/Simulation/Output/index.html) of the SUMO traffic simulation tool for an example of the wide range of data formats that transport datasets can output.

This raises the question, what are transport network datasets?
The intuitive definition is that route network datasets are digital representations of footpaths, cycleways, highways and other ways along which people and goods can travel.
More formally, transport network datasets must contain, at a minimum, geographic information on the coordinates of vertices (points along ways) and edges (the straight lines between vertices representing ways).
Usually they also contain attributes associated with these ways.
File formats for representing them include Transportation Network Test Problem (TNTP and stored as a series of `.tntp` plain text files, examples of which can be found in [github.com/bstabler/TransportationNetworks](https://github.com/bstabler/TransportationNetworks)), `.DAT` files used by the proprietary SATURN transport modelling system and XML-based `.osm` or `.pbf` files that encode OpenStreetMap data.

A more recent approach is to represent transport networks in standard geographic file formats.
In this approach, used in the present paper, transport networks are represented as a series of non-overlapping linestrings, with attributes such as way type and flow.
Making transport datasets compliant with the 'simple features' geographic data specification in this way has many advantages compared with the proliferation of formats used by proprietary software, enabling more easier sharing of datasets between people and programs.
The simple features standard is formalised by the International Organization for Standardization in [ISO 19125-1:2004](https://www.iso.org/standard/40114.html) and implemented in a wide range of file formats such as ESRIs shapefile, GeoJSON, and the open standard for geographic data, GeoPackage.
For ease of data sharing, we share transport networks used in this paper as plain text GeoJSON files.

Much research has focussed on generating and modelling transport network datasets.
This is unsurprising given the importance of transport networks as inputs and outputs of transport models.
Much has been written about network 'cleaning' and simplification as a pre-processing step in transport modelling.
<!-- Todo: add papers on network cleaning and simplification. --> However, there has been relatively little research into transport network visualisation, despite the importance of visualisation to enable more people to understand transport models, for informing policies and prioritising investment in transport planning.

@morgan2020 presented methods for combining multiple overlapping routes into a single route network with non-overlapping linestrings for visualisation, implemented in the function `overline()`.
The approach takes overlapping linestrings representing multiple routes and combines them into a single network with non-overlapping linestrings.
The approach has been used to visualise large transport networks, informing investment decisions in transport planning internationally.
However, the 'overline' approach, without further processing, has limitations:

-   It does not remove redundant vertices, which can lead to large file sizes and slow rendering.
-   It does not remove redundant edges, which can lead to visual artefacts.
-   Parallel ways that are part of the same corridor are not merged into a single way, resulting in outputs that are difficult to interpret.

The final point is most relevant to the present paper.
An example of the issue is shown in @fig-pct from the Propensity to Cycle Tool for England (PCT), with segment values representing daily commuter cycling potential flows [@lovelace2017].
The left panel shows Otley Road with a flow value of 818 (@fig-otley-road).
The right panel, by contrast, shows three parallel ways parallel to Armley Road with flow values of 515 (shown), 288 and 47 (values not shown) (@fig-armley-road).
Although this section of Armley road has a higher cycling potential than the section of Otley Road shown (515 + 288 + 47 \> 818), this is not clear from the visualisation.

A subsequent step described in the paper is to post-process the geographic representation of the transport network into a raster image, which can be used to visualise the network.
The 'rasterisation' stage can tackle some of the issues associated with multiple parallel ways, but introduces new issues, as shown in @fig-rasterisation.

The methods presented in this paper are designed to take a complex network as an input and output a simplified network, while preserving the spatial structure of the network and relevant attribures.
By reducing duplicated parallel lines and other intricacies, the outputs can enable easier-to-interpret visualisations of transport behaviour on the network patterns and behaviors.

The aim of this paper is to outline approaches for visualising transport networks that address the issues associated with multiple parallel ways.
Furthermore we present solutions, implemented with open source software for reproducible and scalable results, to support better visualisation of transport networks for more evidence-based and sustainable transport planning.

@sec-methods describes the input datasets and methods used to generate the results presented in this paper.
@sec-results presents the results, illustrated by network maps of the example datasets.
Finally, @sec-discussion discusses the results and outlines future work.

# Data

# Methods {#sec-methods}

Two fundamental approaches to simplifying transport networks are:

-   Simplifying the geometry of the network, by removing redundant vertices and edges and/or by merging parallel ways and *then* merging the attributes of the original network onto the simplified network.
-   Iteratively removing edges and updating the attributes of the remaining edges by routing through the network.

In this paper we will focus on the former approach, which assumes that a simplified geographic representation of the network is available.

## Geometry simplification

A prerequisite of simple networks is simple geometries.

### Topology-preserving simplification

```{r}
#| include: false
knitr::opts_chunk$set(message = FALSE, warning = FALSE)

```

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: false
# Create input dataset:
network = sf::read_sf("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nptscot/networkmerge/e6f25a7214c15c9c2d5e2cb99a5e4bd4dd92c1b5/data/minimal-example-2-scotthall-road.geojson")
network$description = as.numeric(network$description)
network = network["description"]
network$value = c(1, 2)
network = stplanr::overline(network, attrib = "value")
network
sf::write_sf(network, "data/minimal-input.geojson")
plot(network[1, "value"])
plot(network[2, "value"])
network_merged = network
network_merged$value[2] = network_merged$value[1] + network_merged$value[2]
network_merged = network_merged[-1, ]
plot(network_merged)
sf::write_sf(network_merged, "data/minimal-output.geojson")
```

Topology-preserving simplification reduces the number of vertices in a linestring while preserving the topology of the network.
As shown in top panel of @fig-topology-preserving, topology-preserving simplication *can* reduce the number of edges, but fails to merge parallel lines in complex geometries, as shown in the the bottom panel in @fig-topology-preserving.

### Simplification with parallel edge removal

A more aggressive approach is to simplify and alter network topology in a single step, "through the removal of duplicate or parallel edges, and combining simply-connected nodes" [@deakin2023].

<!-- An approach to simplification with parallel edge removal is described in the `buffer-aggregate` document that accompanies this paper. -->

## Merging simple and detailed networks

After you have a simplified version of the network, from any source, the next step is merging the attributes.
