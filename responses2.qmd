Dear Prof. Lovelace:Manuscript ID EPB-2024-0819.R1 entitled "Route network simplification for transport planning" which you submitted to Environment and Planning B: Urban Analytics and City Science, has been reviewed.  The comments of the referee(s) are included at the bottom of this letter.

I have received two reports on your revised version and, as you'll see, both congratulate you on your work in fleshing the paper our further. I think we're nearly there. I'm sending this back with a very minor revision to allow you to incorporate the small but useful changes suggested by both reviewers. R.1 has bigger concerns around the length of the paper and the possibility that some of the appendices were moved into the text. I'll leave it up to you if that is possible or desirable, given the constraints of Urban Data/Code. The referee(s) have suggested some minor revisions to your manuscript.  Therefore, I invite you to respond to the referee(s)' comments and revise your manuscript. Since this revision is fairly minor, I'll review it myself to speed up the process.

Comments to the Author
The authors present a *dramatically* improved revision to the initial submission with more developed methods, comparisons, and interprations. However, much of the improvement is actually found in the Appendix. I would suggest moving at least some of the material in the Appendix the body of the manuscript (specifically some of the figures) in Section 3 [Data and Methods]. While much more fleshed out the original submission, the manuscript is still too short. I'd like to see more language and explanation in Section 2 [Problem Description], Section 4 [Application to Edinburgh City Centre], and Section 5 [Discussion and Conclusion].

I have highlighted specific typos & grammar errors I caught in PDF, and there are multiple run-over code blocks in the Addendum (p. 3-6, 10, 11).

Comments to the Author
I appreciate a thorough revision of the paper. Authors have responded to all of my comments and resolved them in a way I am comfortable with. I can now recommend acceptance. Below are two extremely minor points that might be worth dealing with prior to publishing.

- In the response, authors describe a new API, but the cookbook section 3 seems to use the original one.
- Occasionally, lines in the cookbook are too long to fit on the page. -->

Dear Prof. Arribas-Bel, reviewers and editorial team,

We thank you again for the opportunity to update the revision of our manuscript and for the continued constructive feedback provided by the reviewers.
We would like to highlight reviewer 1's observation that the paper is "*dramatically* improved" (emphasis theirs) and reviewer 2's comment to the effect that the paper is ready for publication, noting that we "responded to all of my comments and resolved them in a way I am comfortable with. I can now recommend acceptance."

We have carefully considered the final set of comments and suggestions, and we are very grateful for them as they have helped us to further improve the manuscript, and the work's usefulness to the community.

To help the review process, we have numbered each of the reviewers' comments and provided our responses with reference to these.

# Reviewer 1

Outstanding paper review comments:

R1: Significantly improved with more developed methods, comparisons, and interpretations but the paper is too short:

- [x] R1.1 **Paper** Section 3 [Data and Methods]. Move material in the Appendix to the body of the manuscript (specifically the figures) to Data and Methods.

We appreciate this suggestion but unfortunately we are up against the word count limit associated with Urban Data/Code submissions:

> [Urban Data/Code] Manuscripts are short, no more than 3,000 words in length including all text in the article as well as visual aids such as maps, images or figures. As a guideline, each figure or table is equivalent to between 250 (half page) and 500 (full page) words.

We counter that the conciseness of the manuscript is a strength. However, we have acted on this suggestion by more clearly directing people who want to see the details, and run the code, to the Appendices and the GitHub repository.
As the reviewer notes, the Appendices are very useful for people who want a 'deep dive' into the methods and, vitally, for people wanting to run the code for themselves. We have therefore added references to the Appendices earlier in the main text, signposting people to them in the Introduction now.

- [x] R1.2 **Paper** Section 2 [Problem Description], more words and explanation.

We have added content to the previously very concise problem definition section, describing the two key elements of the simplification process: replacing 2 or more parallel lines with a single line and converting complex intersections (e.g. a roundabout) into a single node. We also added a reference to the Methods appendix for details.

- [x] R1.3 **Paper** Section 4 [Application to Edinburgh City Centre], more words and explanation.

We have expanded the Edinburgh application section with detailed analysis of method performance and practical implications. The section now includes specific network dimensions ("an area around 1 km 'wide' (east-west) and 0.5 km 'tall' (north-south)"), comprehensive method comparison ("The Voronoi method demonstrates superior handling of intersection geometries, producing cleaner alignments that more closely follow the natural centrelines of intersecting streets. This advantage comes at a computational cost, with processing times typically 3-5 times longer than skeletonisation"), enhanced discussion of the `neatnet` comparison ("While `neatnet` achieves effective simplification of complex features like the roundabout in the northern portion of the study area, it occasionally produces fragmented segments that require additional post-processing"), and practical guidance for transport planning applications ("From a practical transport planning perspective, the simplified networks offer several advantages over the original OpenStreetMap data. The consolidation of dual carriageways into single centrelines reduces visual clutter and makes it easier to identify traffic flow patterns and bottlenecks").

- [ ] R1.4 **Paper** Section 5 [Discussion and Conclusion]. more words and explanation.



# Reviewer 2
Outstanding paper review comments:

R2:  A thorough revision of the paper with two  minor points that could addressed
  - [x]  R2.1 **Cookbook**.  Section 3. Update cookbook section 3 use the new not the original API.
  - [x]  R2.2 **Cookbook**. Fix the code block to fit on the page.

**Changes made to address R2.1 and R2.2:**

The cookbook has been updated to use the new `parenx` command-line API instead of the original direct Python script calls. Key changes include:

- **API Migration: Updated all examples from `skeletonize.py URL file.gpkg` to `parenx skeletonize URL file.gpkg`
- Code Formatting: Added `monofontoptions: 'Scale=0.2'` to improve code block display and fit content on the page
- Line Breaks: Added line breaks in long command examples for better readability
- Variable Usage: Updated examples to use proper shell variable syntax (`${URL}`)
- Content Cleanup: Removed the old "Application Programming Interface (API) Example" section that used direct Python function calls
- Consistency: Updated function calls in `methods.qmd` and `paper.qmd` to use the new API pattern
- Typography: Fixed spelling from "skeletonise" to "skeletonize" for consistency

These changes improve the presentation and readability of the code examples.
