Dear Prof. Arribas-Bel, reviewers and editorial team,

We thank you again for the opportunity to update the revision of our manuscript and for the continued constructive feedback provided by the reviewers.
We would like to highlight reviewer 1's observation that the paper is "*dramatically* improved" (emphasis theirs) and reviewer 2's comment to the effect that the paper is ready for publication, noting that we "responded to all of my comments and resolved them in a way I am comfortable with. I can now recommend acceptance."

We have carefully considered the final set of comments and suggestions, and we are very grateful for them as they have helped us to further improve the manuscript, and the work's usefulness to the community.

To help the review process, we have numbered each of the reviewers' comments and provided our responses with reference to these.

# Reviewer 1

Outstanding paper review comments:

R1: Significantly improved with more developed methods, comparisons, and interpretations but the paper is too short:
- [ ] R1.1 **Paper** Section 3 [Data and Methods]. Move material in the Appendix to the body of the manuscript (specifically the figures) to Data and Methods.
- [ ] R1.2 **Paper** Section 2 [Problem Description], more words and explanation.
- [ ] R1.3 **Paper** Section 4 [Application to Edinburgh City Centre], more words and explanation.
- [ ] R1.4 **Paper** Section 5 [Discussion and Conclusion]. more words and explanation.

# Reviewer 2
Outstanding paper review comments:

R2:  A thorough revision of the paper with two  minor points that could addressed
  - [x]  R2.1 **Cookbook**.  Section 3. Update cookbook section 3 use the new not the original API.
  - [x]  R2.2 **Cookbook**. Fix the code block to fit on the page.

**Changes made to address R2.1 and R2.2:**

The cookbook has been updated to use the new `parenx` command-line API instead of the original direct Python script calls. Key changes include:

- **API Migration: Updated all examples from `skeletonize.py URL file.gpkg` to `parenx skeletonize URL file.gpkg`
- Code Formatting: Added `monofontoptions: 'Scale=0.2'` to improve code block display and fit content on the page
- Line Breaks: Added line breaks in long command examples for better readability
- Variable Usage: Updated examples to use proper shell variable syntax (`${URL}`)
- Content Cleanup: Removed the old "Application Programming Interface (API) Example" section that used direct Python function calls
- Consistency: Updated function calls in `methods.qmd` and `paper.qmd` to use the new API pattern
- Typography: Fixed spelling from "skeletonise" to "skeletonize" for consistency

These changes improve the presentation and readability of the code examples.
