# Abstract

# Introduction

Datasets representing route networks are central to transport planning
as key inputs *and* output. Origin-destination, GPS, and remote sensing
imagery datasets are all key inputs but rarely feature as outputs of
transport models. Estimates of costs and benefits associated with
changes to transport systems, geographic outputs at regional, local and
corridor level, and visualisation of agents on the system are common
outputs. However, route network datasets are ubiquitous as both
transport model inputs (typically representing road networks) outputs
(typically for visualising model outputs such as flow per time of
day).[^1]

This raises questions about what transport network datasets are, and how
they can be optimized for more effective decision-making. An intuitive
definition is that route network datasets are digital representations of
footpaths, cycleways, highways and other *ways* (to use the
OpenStreetMap terminology) along which people and goods can travel. More
formally, transport network datasets must contain, at a minimum,
geographic information on the coordinates of vertices (points along
ways) and edges (the straight lines between vertices representing ways).
Usually they also contain attributes such as the type of way, it’s
characteristics (e.g. is lit at night), and the amount of traffic using
each segment.

File formats for representing route networks include Transportation
Network Test Problem files (TNTP and stored as a series of `.tntp` plain
text files, examples of which can be found in
[github.com/bstabler/TransportationNetworks](https://github.com/bstabler/TransportationNetworks)),
`.DAT` files used by the proprietary SATURN transport modelling system
and XML-based `.osm` or `.pbf` files that encode OpenStreetMap data. A
more recent approach is to represent transport networks in standard
geographic file formats. In this approach, used in the present paper,
transport networks are represented as a series of non-overlapping
linestrings, with attributes such as way type and flow. Making transport
datasets compliant with the ‘simple features’ geographic data
specification in this way has advantages,
<!-- compared with the proliferation of formats used by proprietary software, -->
enabling more easier sharing of datasets between people and programs.
The simple features standard is formalised by the International
Organization for Standardization in [ISO
19125-1:2004](https://www.iso.org/standard/40114.html) and implemented
in a wide range of file formats such as ESRIs shapefile, GeoJSON, and
the open standard for geographic data, GeoPackage. For ease of data
sharing, we share transport networks used in this paper as plain text
GeoJSON files.

A problem associated with the trend towards geographic representation of
route networks is increasing file sizes and complexity. With the
increasing availability of high resolution imagery, citizens (e.g. via
OpenStreetMap) and national mapping agencies are mapping more and more
detail. Overall this is a good thing for transport planning research,
but excess complexity and intricacy can lead to problems, as outlined in
the next section.

The aim of this paper is to articulate the problem of complex route
networks, present solutions with implementations in open source software
for reproducible research, and describe applications of the methods to
support more effective transport planning. [Section 2](#sec-problem)
outlines the problem of complex route networks. [Section 3](#sec-data)
describes the input datasets. [Section 4](#sec-methods) presents methods
for route network simplification alongside results based on the example
datasets. In [Section 5](#sec-discussion) we discuss the results and
outline future work.

<!-- Much research has focussed on generating and modelling transport network datasets.
This is unsurprising given the importance of transport networks as inputs and outputs of transport models.
Much has been written about network 'cleaning' and simplification as a pre-processing step in transport modelling. -->
<!-- Todo: add papers on network cleaning and simplification. -->
<!-- However, there has been relatively little research into transport network visualisation, despite the importance of visualisation to enable more people to understand transport models, for informing policies and prioritising investment in transport planning. -->

# Prior work and problem definition

Morgan and Lovelace (2020) presented methods for combining multiple
overlapping routes into a single route network with non-overlapping
linestrings for visualisation, implemented in the function `overline()`.
The approach takes overlapping linestrings representing multiple routes
and combines them into a single network with non-overlapping
linestrings. The approach has been used to visualise large transport
networks, informing investment decisions in transport planning
internationally. However, the ‘overline’ approach, without further
processing, has limitations:

- It does not remove redundant vertices, which can lead to large file
  sizes and slow rendering.
- Parallel ways that are part of the same corridor are not merged into a
  single way, resulting in outputs that are difficult to interpret.

The final point is most relevant to the present paper. An example of the
issue is shown in [Figure 1](#fig-pct) from the Propensity to Cycle Tool
for England (PCT), with segment values representing daily commuter
cycling potential flows (Lovelace et al. 2017). The left panel shows
Otley Road with a flow value of 818 ([Figure 1 (a)](#fig-otley-road)).
The right panel, by contrast, shows three parallel ways parallel to
Armley Road with flow values of 515 (shown), 288 and 47 (values not
shown) ([Figure 1 (b)](#fig-armley-road)). Although this section of
Armley road has a higher cycling potential than the section of Otley
Road shown (515 + 288 + 47 \> 818), this is not clear from the
visualisation.

A subsequent step described in the paper is to post-process the
geographic representation of the transport network into a raster image,
which can be used to visualise the network. The ‘rasterisation’ stage
can tackle some of the issues associated with multiple parallel ways,
but introduces new issues, as shown in [Figure 2](#fig-rasterisation).

The methods presented in this paper are designed to take a complex
network as an input and output a simplified network, while preserving
the spatial structure of the network and relevant attributes. By
reducing duplicated parallel lines and other intricacies, the outputs
can enable easier-to-interpret visualisations of transport behaviour on
the network patterns and behaviors.

# Data

# Methods

There are two main challenges that need to be overcome to simplify
transport networks, in a way that preserves their value:

1.  Simplifying the *geometry*
2.  Assigning attributes to the simplified network

## Simplifying the geometry

<!-- 
&#10;Two fundamental approaches to simplifying transport networks are:
&#10;-   Simplifying the geometry of the network, by removing redundant vertices and edges and/or by merging parallel ways and *then* merging the attributes of the original network onto the simplified network.
-   Iteratively removing edges and updating the attributes of the remaining edges by routing through the network.
&#10;In this paper we will focus on the former approach, which assumes that a simplified geographic representation of the network is available. -->

### Topology-preserving simplification

Topology-preserving simplification reduces the number of vertices in a
linestring while preserving the topology of the network. As shown in top
panel of [Figure 3](#fig-topology-preserving), topology-preserving
simplication *can* reduce the number of edges, but fails to merge
parallel lines in complex geometries, as shown in the the bottom panel
in [Figure 3](#fig-topology-preserving).

A more aggressive approach is to simplify and alter network topology in
a single step, “through the removal of duplicate or parallel edges, and
combining simply-connected nodes” (Deakin 2023). Two approaches to this
are outlined below.

### Network Simplification

There are two simplification approaches based presented either using
image skeletonization or Voronoi diagram to finding a centre line.

### Create a projected combined buffered geometry:

Both approaches a buffer, in this case 8.0m, is applied to the base
network lines.

The buffered street network to be simplified is

![base network](paper_files/figure-commonmark/unnamed-chunk-8-5.png)

![buffer network](paper_files/figure-commonmark/unnamed-chunk-8-6.png)

Edinburgh Princes Street buffer network

### Skeletonization

Buffered lines are combined to form a raster image and thinned to
produce to a skeletal remnant that preserves the extent and connectivity
centred on a line centred on the combined buffered region, using the
Edinburgh GeoJSON network as above.

#### Create the affine transformation between the points in the buffer and raster image

A scaled affine transformations between the projected coordinate
geometry and scaled raster image is calculated.

### Affine transforms

#### Rasterio transform

    |     |      |        |
    |----:|-----:|-------:|
    | 0.5 |  0   | 324166 |
    | 0   | -0.5 | 674527 |
    | 0   |  0   |      1 |

#### Shapely transform

    |     |      |        |
    |----:|-----:|-------:|
    | 0   | -0.5 | 324166 |
    | 0.5 |  0   | 674527 |

In this example a scale factor of 2.0 is used.

### Skeletonize the buffer to a point geometry

A scaled affine transformation is applied to the projected coordinate
geometry to create a scaled raster image. The raster image is then
cleaned to remove small holes in the image, typically where buffer lines
run parallel or intersect at shallow angles.

![](paper_files/figure-commonmark/unnamed-chunk-12-9.png)

The image is then thinned and the resulting giving skeleton raster
image.

![](paper_files/figure-commonmark/unnamed-chunk-13-11.png)

The point geometry can then be transformed back to a point geometry.

![](paper_files/figure-commonmark/unnamed-chunk-14-13.png)

The issue with this is that rather than points that lie on the
simplified network, we need a simplified set of lines not a set. This
requires the line geometry to be inferred from associated points.

### Conversion from point to line geometry

Creating a simplified line geometry from a skeletonized point set is
arguably the most awkward step in creating a simplified network.

First identify all adjacent points, which are points within a 1x1 px
square in the raster coordinate system. Then create line segments from
lines between all adjacent points, and finally combine and the resultant
lines geometries.

To see the simplified network requires the reverse affine transformation
to be applied,

![](paper_files/figure-commonmark/unnamed-chunk-16-15.png)

### Knots

Where lines intersect multiple short segment may occur which look like
knots.

To remove these these short segments are clustered, a cluster
centre-point calculated, end-points of longer-lines connected to the
segment cluser are then moved to cluster centre-point, removing the
knot. As before, prior to plotting the simplified network the reverse
affine transformation is applied,

![](paper_files/figure-commonmark/unnamed-chunk-17-17.png)

### Primal network

There are circumstances where it may useful to see a “primal” network,
that only consists of lines from start and end points,

![](paper_files/figure-commonmark/unnamed-chunk-19-19.png)

## Simplification via voronoi polygons

In this approach lines are buffered, the buffer edges segmented into
sequences of points and a centre-line derived from a set of Voronoi
polygons convering these .

### Boundary

### Segment

### Point

### Voronoi

### Voronoi 2

## Merging simple and detailed networks

After you have a simplified version of the network, from any source, the
next step is merging the attributes.
